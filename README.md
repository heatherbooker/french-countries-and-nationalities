### french countries and nationalities  

a tool to supplement other methods of language learning

--> *ie*, this came about because I was dissatisfied with the countries and nationalities presented on Duolingo

currently implemented for English learners to learn in French  

uses react.js and JSX  

totally a copycat of duolingo

# frenchly  
### french countries and nationalities  

a tool to supplement other methods of language learning

--> this came about because I wanted to learn more countries and nationalities!

currently implemented for English learners to learn in French  

uses react.js and JSX  

totally a copycat of duolingo

#### to run:  
locally:
```
git clone https://github.com/heatherbooker/frenchly.git  
cd frenchly  
npm install  
npm run start
```  

open localhost:8080 in browser

#####voila!

#### bonus!
frenchly led to the publishing of [react-world-map](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-world-map), a React component with a clickable SVG based map, as well as [this article](https://medium.com/@heatherbooker/how-to-make-an-interactive-map-in-react-f4e6e074b500#.jmv9y1z16) on its creation.
